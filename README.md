# MagneticOne Multi-Agent System - Open-Source Exploration

Welcome to the open-source exploration of Microsoftâ€™s MagneticOne multi-agent system! This repository provides a summarized workflow, a visual diagram, and an initial implementation in LangGraph. We encourage the community to contribute, test, and enhance this adaptation from Autogen to LangGraph.

---

## Overview

The MagneticOne multi-agent system, developed by Microsoft, is designed to enable efficient, multi-agent coordination and decision-making. This repository aims to:
1. Explain the workflow of MagneticOne in a concise format.
2. Provide a simple diagram to visualize the core process.
3. Present a first draft implementation using LangGraph.

This project serves as a foundation for adapting Microsoft's work with Autogen to a LangGraph-based system.

## Getting Started

To get involved, clone the repo, check out the initial draft in LangGraph, and run tests to see it in action. 

### Prerequisites

- **LangGraph** installed.
- Familiarity with multi-agent systems is recommended.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelRTM/magnetic-one-langgraph.git
cd magneticone-multi-agent-system
# Install dependencies as required
